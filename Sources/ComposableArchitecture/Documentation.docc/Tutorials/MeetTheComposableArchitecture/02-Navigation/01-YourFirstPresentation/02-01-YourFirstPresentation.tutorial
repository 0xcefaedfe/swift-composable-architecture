    The Composable Architecture offers a variety of tools to help you present child features
    from parent features. To begin, we will explore presenting a feature that is driven off
    of optional state.

      Suppose that you are working on an application that shows a list of users at the root, and you
      want to add the ability to create a new user. This should be done by tapping a "+" icon in the
      UI, a sheet will be presented where you can enter the user's info, and then tapping a button
      will dismiss the sheet and add the contact to the list.

        We will start by creating a new file, ContactsFeature.swift, and we will get the very basics
        of our contacts feature in this file. Currently that consts of a simple `Contact` model
        data type, and a simple reducer with a collection of contacts, and a single action for
        when the "+" button is tapped. Currently that action is not yet implemented.
