# Migrating to reducer protocols

Learn how to migrate existing applications to use the new `ReducerProtocol`, in both Swift 5.7 and Swift 5.6.

The ``ReducerProtocol`` makes use of many new features of Swift 5.7, including primary associated types and constrained opaque types. If you are already using Swift 5.7+, then you can start making use of these features right away. If you are using Swift 5.6 then you can still make use of ``ReducerProtocol``, but with a few minor tweaks.
